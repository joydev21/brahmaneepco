## BRAHMA (Braided River Aid: Hydro-Morphological Analyzer)

The BRAHMA-2D model is an indigenous model to help gauge the flow of large braided rivers like the Brahmaputra and help engineers while taking river bank protection measures.
It integrates a 2-dimensional water movement model with entropy theory, providing insights into disorder and randomness in river flow.
It addresses challenges in predicting river flow variations across depth, essential for flood and erosion control, agriculture, water supply design, and energy production.
It was developed in collaboration with the Brahmaputra Board.

## Significance:
Traditional measurement methods during high monsoons are risky and difficult, leading to the adoption of mathematical models.
Existing models provide only average velocity, while BRAHMA-2D accounts for undercurrents at different depths, crucial for accurate predictions.
Braided rivers, characterized by sandbars, pose additional challenges, and this model is designed to address these complexities.
River bank erosion is a severe issue in Assam, particularly along the Brahmaputra and its tributaries.

## Application:
BRAHMA-2D aids in designing sustainable hydraulic structures like spurs and river bank protection measures to mitigate erosion.
Its quasi-3D representation enables understanding of water movement at various depths and its circulation around structures like spurs.
